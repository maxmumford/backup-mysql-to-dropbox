Introduction
========
This is a python script that will let you backup a MySQL database, zip it, then upload it to your drop box. It can also auto-delete backups older than X days. It can be used in conjunction with a cron job on linux.

So far only tested on ubuntu but should work on all linux distros.

Setup
=========
- Install the python api for dropbox by following the instructions here:

https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/sdks/python

- Get an API Key and Secret from the following URL:

https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

- Run the backup utility once to authenticate your app with your user with the following command:

python backup_and_upload.py -d db_name_1,db_name_2 -u mysql_username -p mysql_password -k dropbox_app_key -s dropbox_app_secret

- To automatically run the script periodically, type crontab -e and hit enter
- Then add the following line to the end of the file (Changing paths and parameters as appropriate):

0 0 * * * cd /var/cron/backup_mysql_to_dropbox/ && python /var/cron/backup_mysql_to_dropbox/backup_and_upload.py -u mysql_username -p mysql_password -d db_to_backup_1,db_to_backup_2 -k dropbox_app_key -s dropbox_app_secret

- To automatically delete backups older than X days, use the -x argument

*The above crontab line will run the script once a day. Refer to the crontab documentation to change the interval*

*Show help messages for backup_and_upload.py by running backup_and_reload.py --help*
